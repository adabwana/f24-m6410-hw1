The code provided here demonstrates a functional programming approach to solving various probability problems, including binomial distributions, normal distributions, and calculations involving expected values and standard deviations.\nThe code is organized into different sections corresponding to each homework problem, with detailed explanations of the logic and mathematical steps involved. By using Clojure and its associated libraries, such as scicloj.clay for rendering, tablecloth for data manipulation, and fastmath for mathematical operations.\n\nUtils\nThe utils.clj file contains various utility functions and helpers used throughout the homework solutions. It includes:\n\nFormatting functions for markdown and LaTeX rendering\nStatistical functions for binomial and normal distributions\nVisualization functions for creating plots\nHelper functions for calculations and data manipulation\n\nThese utilities are designed to streamline the problem-solving process and provide reusable components for statistical computations and visualizations.\nThe code in the src/assignments folder was rendered with Clay and deployed with Github Pages.\nNote: Plots rendered from ggplots are not displayed correctly. The first ggplot per question displays nicely. The others, alas.\n\nsource: src/index.clj",
